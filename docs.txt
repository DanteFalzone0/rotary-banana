*** Functions in the header file "banana.hpp" . ***

fresh_frame() : display the frame afresh. When called, this function
                will erase the previous frame and replace it.

advance_frame(int milliseconds) : does the same as fresh_frame(), but waits for
                                  a given number of milliseconds immediately afterwards.
                                  For example, `advance_frame(42);` will refresh the
                                  frame and wait about 1/24th of a second before
                                  continuing the program. You could put this in a
                                  while loop to make a continuously refreshing frame.


blit(char, int x, int y) : changes one of the cells of the frame. The frame has twenty
                           rows and forty columns. Calling this function will replace
                           the cell whose coordinates it is given with its first
                           argument. For example, `blit('X', 3, 17);` will put the
                           character 'X' in the third cell on the seventeenth line.
                           Note that merely calling blit() will not on its own result
                           in a visible change in the frame's contents; you must thereafter
                           refresh the frame to see the character.

line(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, char) : draw a line from (x0, y0) to (x1, y1)
                                             rendered in char. For example,
                                             `line(2, 2, 18, 18, 'X');` will make
                                             a line of 'X'es with endpoints at
                                             coordinates (2, 2) and (18, 18). Note
                                             that, as with blit(), you must refresh
                                             the frame to see the line.
