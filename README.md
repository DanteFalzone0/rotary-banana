NOTICE posted 30 December 2019

I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program.
The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would
write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository
as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent
repositories instead.

The "banana.hpp" header file and some programs that use it.
This header file is for rendering animated ascii art in
text-based terminal emulators.
